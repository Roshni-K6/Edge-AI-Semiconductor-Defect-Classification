***Dataset Details:***

Total images (current): 1,200+ images

Number of classes: 9 classes (7 defect classes + Clean + Other)

Class list:  clean, other, particle/contamination, scratch, opens, cracks, cmp, vias, bridges

Class balance plan: Minimum ~120 images per class to maintain balanced learning and avoid bias toward dominant defect types.

Train / Validation / Test split: 70% / 15% / 15%

Image type: Grayscale images (converted to 3-channel format for CNN compatibility)

Labeling method / source: Manually curated and labeled from publicly available semiconductor defect images sourced from research publications and open references.
Data augmentation was applied to increase sample count while preserving defect characteristics.
